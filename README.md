# Introduction

This is a project that was thought up by my son [Braeden](http://braeden.logiodice.com).  He realized that you could mask out the 3 MSB of an ASCII letter
and you could then get a count of 1 to 26 for a-zA-Z.  Braeden then invented a way to represent the letters using 1-26 through a series of dots and dashes
which could be encoded and decoded into a cipher text.

## Usage
The following outlines how to use this code to encode and decode the cipher text

### Encode
braesec.py -e "Your text here"

### Decode
Coming soon!

#### Summary
X' .X -'X. .X. [SPACE] 'X. -.X. 'X:
